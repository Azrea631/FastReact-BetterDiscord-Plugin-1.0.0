# FastReact
A BetterDiscord plugin that lets you instantly react to messages with a default emoji (❤️ by default) using two quick-access methods:  
- **Right-click menu:** Adds “React with ❤️” to any message.  
- **Chat bar button:** Adds a small heart button next to the gift icon that sends your emoji directly to the chat.  

Fully customizable — change the emoji anytime from the plugin’s settings.
